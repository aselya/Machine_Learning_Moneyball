This program parses through baseball statistics using them to train a neural network
The Neural network is used to as part of the fitness function of a genetic algorithim
The genetic algorithm's goal is to find the essential statistics for building a playoff
baseball team by incentivizing underperforming or average stats 


To initiate using pre-made CSVs
1. Load all files
2. Access Genetic_algorithim_Componenet.py and run it

To initiate the algorithm from scratch 
1. run the Data_extraction_and_sanitization.py file to prepare the data
2. follow instructions for initiate using pre-made CSVs
